# Sparsifying Tactile Data by Wavelet Transform
-- took stag data --> computed 75 wavelet transforms and quantiation --> evaluated sparsity metrics --> inverse transformed with certain rules --> fed recon data into NN classifier directly ad measured class acc
MATLAB
- main fuction which is compressing the data by wavelet transform and quantization
- associated functions that evaluate stuff
Python
- 

Stag dataset is found at --> unzip, extract metadata and convert pressure to variable "Stag.mat"
